# Rampage
## Description
Script mod that adds new rampages to GTA V. In a rampage, you have to take down a specified ammount of enemies in a set ammount of time to pass the challenge. Unlike GTA V rampages, here each rampage has different settings, different weapon loadouts, more/less time, etc.

For those that like an extra challenge, each rampage also feature extra objectives. These can be "Kill X number of enemies", "Destroy X number of vehicles" and/or "Get X number of headshots".

## Controls
Go to a rampage location and press E or DPad Right (*editable in the config.json file*) to start a Rampage.
